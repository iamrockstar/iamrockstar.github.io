I am ROCKSTAR 10X DEV and you can be too.  Just follow my blog.  I will give all my 2 year career experience to all other apsiring devs so they can dev harder and be 10x dev.  Just follow blog and you will become more better x dev.

Check this out:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
